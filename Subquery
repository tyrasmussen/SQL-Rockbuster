This is one of the queries used in the analysis. Within this query is a subquery:

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS "AVERAGE"
FROM
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name AS "customer first name", A.last_name AS "customer last name", D.country, C.city, SUM(E.amount) AS "total_amount_paid"
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY "total_amount_paid" desc
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
