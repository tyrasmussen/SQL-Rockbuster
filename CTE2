Here is one of the SQL queries using a common table expression that was used for the final insights:

WITH all_customers_cte (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city, all_customer_count)
AS (SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name AS "customer first name", A.last_name AS "customer last name", D.country, C.city, SUM(E.amount) AS "total amount paid"
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city
ORDER BY "total amount paid" desc
LIMIT 5)
SELECT customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, country, city, all_customer_count
FROM all_customers_cte
